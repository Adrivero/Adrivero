Hi!

I'm AdriÃ¡n, an Aerospace Engineer currently pursuing quantitative finance and algorithmic trading career. In my free time, I enjoy learning new things and working on my personal projects. Through these projects, I aim not only to apply the concepts I learn but also to invest my own capital based on the strategies I develop. I hope you find them useful and do not hesitate to message me with new ideas/improvements or bugs you found!

Brief summary of my repositories:
- [Fully integrated trading tool (Fitt)](https://github.com/Adrivero/Fitt) -> My flagship project, aims to be the only Python library I need for the entire lifecycle of a strategy and model implementation, from development and backtesting to deployment and portfolio allocation.
- [Multilayer Perceptron and Strategy](https://github.com/Adrivero/MultilayerPerceptronStrategy) -> Coded from scratch a simple Multilayer perceptron and then used it to predict future closing prices. Includes a simple backtest.
- [FDM Simulation](https://github.com/Adrivero/FiniteDifferenceMethodSphere) -> Finite Difference Method (FDM) coded from scratch and used to solve the transient heat equation PDE on a sphere.
