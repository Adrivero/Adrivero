Hi!

I'm Adri√°n, an Aerospace Engineer currently pursuing quantitative finance and algorithmic trading career. In my free time, I enjoy learning new things and working on personal projects. Through these projects, I aim not only to apply the concepts I learn but also to invest my own capital based on the strategies I develop. I hope you find them useful and do not hesitate to message me with new ideas/improvements or bugs you found!

Brief summary of my repositories:
- [Fitt](https://github.com/Adrivero/Fitt): My flagship project, aims to be the only Python library I need for the entire lifecycle of a strategy and model implementatio, from development and backtesting to deployment and portfolio allocation.
